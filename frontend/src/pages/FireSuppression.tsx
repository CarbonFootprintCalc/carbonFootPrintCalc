            <p>
              Emissions from fire suppression systems arise from the release of specific chemicals, primarily HFCs, PFCs, and COâ‚‚, from fire suppression devices during use, maintenance or disposal.
              These sources range from small portable extinguishers to large-scale systems in office buildings or warehouses. Note that other agents (such as Halon compounds, HCFCs, aqueous solutions or inert gases) are typically excluded from the GHG inventory.
